### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Xianpi Duan
A first year Computer Science student at McMaster University. I like to explore different development frameworks and languages. I started learning Java in high school, and during that time I taught myself C/C++, Python, and other languages. I was able to learn a lot of new things in the process, and I really enjoyed the feeling of gaining new knowledge. Right now I am looking for a Coop internship for **Summer 2022**.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

* **[AI-Voice-Diary](https://github.com/duanxianpi/AI-Voice-Diary):** Using voice to keep a journal.
* **[QtLive2d](https://github.com/duanxianpi/QtLive2d):** Qt-based Live2d widget

### ðŸ“– Hobbies
* In my free time I like to read, especially detective novels and science fiction.
